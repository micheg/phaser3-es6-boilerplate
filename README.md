# Phaser 3 ES6 Boilerplate

Hi there 👋

This is a quick and dirty boilerplate to bootstrap Phaser 3 games. It comes complete with:

  - ✅ ES6 syntax support (classes, fat arrow functions, spread operator, etc.)
  - ✅ `async`/`await` support
  - ✅ Local dev server & dev / production build scripts
  - ✅ Updated to the latest version of phaser

## Usage

To bootstrap a project using this boilerplate, click the "Use this template" button on GitHub.

Once you've got it locally, first run:

```
npm install
```

To install project dependencies (PhaserJS is the only non-dev dependency!).

After that, to run a local dev server use:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build (it will be put in a folder called "dist/"), run:

```
npm run build
```

this project is an updated version of: https://github.com/saricden/phaser3-es6-boilerplate
